## About

The React Blockchain Oxhain App provides a hands-on example of how blockchain works by creating a basic blockchain network with blocks and transactions. It showcases the fundamental concepts of blockchain, such as proof-of-work, mining, and decentralization.

## Features

- **Block Creation**: New blocks can be mined and added to the blockchain.
- **Transaction Handling**: Users can create transactions to add data to a block.
- **Proof-of-Work**: Mining process involves finding the right nonce for block validation.
- **Decentralization**: The blockchain is distributed across nodes for added security.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/muhammadshiraz/react-oxhain-app.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd react-blockchain-oxhain-app`.
3. Install the necessary dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

In a separate terminal, start the frontend development server:
