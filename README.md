## About

The React Blockchain Oxhain App provides the first CEX-DEX hybrid crypto derivatives exchange.

Designed by ordinary people with extraordinary values.

## Features

- **Cryptocurrency Trading**: Oxhain allows users to trade a wide range of cryptocurrencies, including popular one like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and many altcoins. Users can buy, sell, and exchange digital assets on the platform.
- **Spot Trading and Futures Trading**: Oxhain supports both spot trading (regular trading) and futures trading, giving users different options for their trading strategies.
- **Margin Trading**: Oxhain offers margin trading, allowing users to trade with borrowed funds, increasing their potential profit (and risk).

- **Decentralization**: The blockchain is distributed across nodes for added security.
